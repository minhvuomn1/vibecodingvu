# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project now includes a CI/CD pipeline with the following features:
- Build stage: Validates project structure and converts source to metadata format
- Test stage: Runs syntax checks, linting, and Apex tests
- No authentication required for org access - only syntax and structure validation
- Rollback and version control testing capabilities
- Performance evaluation for metadata generation

## Scripts

Several utility scripts have been added for testing:
- `scripts/test-rollback.sh`: Tests rollback functionality and version control
- `scripts/performance-test.sh`: Evaluates performance of metadata generation
